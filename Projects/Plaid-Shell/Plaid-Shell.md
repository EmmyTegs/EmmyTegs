# 🐚 Building a Plaid Shell

**Course Project – 2023**

In this project, I built a fully functional shell environment in C as part of a systems programming assignment. The shell supported commands such as:

- `echo`   
- `cat`
- `grep`
- `sed`
- `cd`   
- `home`
- `ls`
- `nano`

### 🔧 What I Did

- Implemented core command parsing and execution
- Used **linked lists** and **hash maps** for command history and environment variables
- Created error handling and redirection features
- Practiced working at the system level with process control and `fork()`

### 🚀 What I Learned

- Deep understanding of Linux internals
- How shell environments handle input, piping, and command execution
- Memory management and dynamic allocation in C

> This project was a major leap in understanding how low-level programs work under the hood—and it made using the terminal feel like second nature.
