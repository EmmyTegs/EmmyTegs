# 🔍 Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing

**Course Project (04720 Ethical Hacking)**

As part of a red team simulation, I conducted a full-scope penetration test against a simulated enterprise environment, mimicking real-world attack scenarios to uncover and exploit security weaknesses.

### 🔧 What I Did

- Performed reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation against corporate systems
- Utilized tools such as **Burp Suite**, **Nmap**, **Metasploit**, and **OWASP ZAP**
- Identified and exploited critical vulnerabilities, including:
  - SQL injection
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Gained unauthorized access to sensitive systems and demonstrated potential business impact

### 📄 Reporting

- Created a comprehensive penetration testing report with:
  - Step-by-step exploitation techniques
  - Screenshots and technical evidence
  - Actionable remediation strategies
- Mapped findings to OWASP Top 10 and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks

### 🚀 What I Learned

- Full penetration testing lifecycle: from information gathering to reporting
- Importance of manual validation and accurate risk scoring
- How to communicate technical risk to business stakeholders effectively

> This Red Team project sharpened my offensive security skills and reinforced my understanding of real-world adversarial techniques.
