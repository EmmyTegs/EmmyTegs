# 🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment of E-Gov Services

**Project – 2024**

This project was a large-scale security assessment of e-government services across 55 African countries, focused on identifying and remediating web-based vulnerabilities on public service portals.

### 🔧 What I Did

- Scanned and analyzed 50,000+ government URLs
- Discovered 400+ confirmed vulnerabilities, including:
  - 150+ high-severity issues (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)
- Developed a methodology using OWASP Testing Guide and manual validation
- Co-authored a formal report with recommendations for national digital security strategy

### 🚀 What I Learned

- Deep insight into large-scale vulnerability management
- Practical experience with manual web app exploitation and false positive elimination
- Effective communication of technical findings to diverse stakeholders

> This project allowed me to combine technical testing with impact-driven recommendations, helping nations improve their cybersecurity posture.
